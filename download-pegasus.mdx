vAMSYS Pegasus is a **required plugin** that connects your simulator to our Virtual Airline systems. It runs in the background to automatically track your flights, record key data, and ensure accurate PIREP submissions. Without Pegasus installed and running, flights **cannot be logged or accepted.**

## Additional installs

In order to link Pegasus to your Flight Simulator, you are also required to install **FSUIPC**'s latest version.

<Warning>
  FSUIPC is only required if you intend to use Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 or 2024. Other simulators are already connected to Pegasus.

## Troubleshoot

If you have any issues during either installation or whilst using the softwares, please follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify that your system meets the minimum requirements for install/use of the software.">
    If your system does not meet the minimum requirements, you may not be able to use the software. If your system does meet the minimum requirements, move on to the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the installer or software as Administrator.">
    Sometimes the software may require Administrator privileges to work properly. If this does not work, move to the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable your Antivirus or Firewall.">
    Try disabling your Antivirus or Firewall as it may prevent the installation and perceive the software or installer as a malware. If this works, you can enable your Antivirus/Firewall again. If this does not work, move on to the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Perform a Fresh Reinstall.">
    If the issue persists, completely remove the software from your system, then reboot your computer before reinstalling the latest version. This ensures no corrupted or leftover files interfere with your computer. Once inrestalled, launch the software and test again. If this does not work, move on to the last step.
